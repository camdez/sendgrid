# sendgrid

A Clojure library for sending emails with [SendGrid][].

## Usage

FIXME

## Motivation

Features differentiating this library from (some of) the alternatives:

- Idiomatic Clojure.
- No global state.
- Convenient handling of files (whether generated or served from
  the file system).
- No errors on long message contents.
- No assumptions about error handling (error handling is caller's
  responsibility).
